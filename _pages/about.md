Hello! My name is Julia!

I am a passionate, analytical, and creative Masters Student at Cornell University studying Operations Research and Information Engineering with a concentration in Data Analytics. I will graduate in December 2024. Recently, I just completed my Bachelors in Operations Research and Information Engineering with minor in Data Science at Cornell University in December 2023. 

Upon completion of my Master's degree, I will go to [Sage Analysis Group](https://sageanalysis.com/) as a Consultant Analyst in Boston, MA, focusing on data science, discrete event simulation, and system dynamics. This summer, I will be working at [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Labratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/) as a Systems and Operations Research and Analysis Intern in Laurel, MD. 

I am interested in the intersection of technology and business, specifically in the realm of Data Analytics and Data Science. I hope to use my strong technical skills to solve complex problems in the consulting and technology industries. I am interested in innovation, technology, data, and critical problem solving in a fast-paced environment. 

I have a wide experience in Industry, Consulting, Engineering, Entrepreneurship, and Academia. I have worked as a Business Intelligence Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), Data Analytics Consulting Associate at [Ankura](https://ankura.com/), a Supply Chain and Operations manager at [Aabix](https://www.aabix.com/) (a Cornell Startup), a [Cornell Rocketry](https://cornellrocketryteam.com/cornell) Business Team Lead, a [Cornell University Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/) Teaching Assistant and an Industrial Engineering Intern at [Rochling](https://www.roechling.com/us/). I am extremely skilled at Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, Simulation Analysis, Modeling Development, Operations Research, Mathematical Modeling, Lean Six Sigma, Statistical Analysis, Optimization, and Excel. 

I have strong leadership, teamwork, and communication skills and a strong desire to learn and accomplish great things!
