I also really love to spend time traveling. 

I have been fortunate enough to see the world in my free time. 

In Europe, I have been to France, Spain (twice), Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland. In the Carribean, I have visited the virgin islands, Jamaica, Turke & Caicos, and the Dominican Republic, and soon, I will go to Costa Rica. I have spent a lot of time in the Kawartha Lakes region of Canada, and have traveled to many states in the US. My next goal destination is New Zealand!
