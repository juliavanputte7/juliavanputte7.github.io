I also love to listen to live music, dance, and see concerts. My main musical genres are a mix of indie, folk, rock, alternative, and pop.

My favorite band is Mt. Joy, an indie-folk-rock group. I have been to three (almost four) of their concerts. 

I am always in for listening to live music of any genre. I just took a trip with my friends to Nashville and am a recent convert of country music.
