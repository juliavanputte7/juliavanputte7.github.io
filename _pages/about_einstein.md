I really enjoy nature and the outdoors. Last summer, I had the pleasure of living in Seattle, WA where I spent my time exploring the Cascades, Mt. Ranier, and Olympic National Park.

I grew up in upstate South Carolina, where I would spend many weekends hiking and mountain biking in the mountains. 

I love to hike, take long walks, and spend time outside. I hope to visit a lot of National Parks in my lifetime and spend as much time outside as possible.
